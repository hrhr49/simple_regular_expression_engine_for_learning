# simple_regular_expression_engine_for_learning
Simple regular expression engine implementation based on NFA(Nondeterministic Finite Automaton).

## NOTE

This repository is created for only learning use. So, feature of this regular expression engine is very poor.

* valid characters: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`
* valid meta characters: `()|*`
* other feature is not implemented!

## Demo

Demo to understand conversion from regular expression to NFA.
